# PDF to Audiobook with LLaMA

This project demonstrates how to convert PDF documents into audiobooks using a Large Language Model (LLM) and text-to-speech (TTS) technology. The core components of the solution are:

- **Text Extraction**: Extracts text from PDF files.
- **Text Processing**: Uses the LLaMA model to summarize and enhance the readability of the text.
- **Text-to-Speech**: Converts the processed text into an audiobook.

## Features

- Extracts and processes text from PDF files.
- Summarizes and modifies text for more natural audiobook narration.
- Converts processed text to speech and saves it as an audio file.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python 3.7 or higher installed on your machine. You can download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/k2iham/audio_py.git
    cd pdf-to-audiobook
    ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

    Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

    Install the required Python packages:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

1. **Prepare your PDF file.** Place the PDF file you want to convert in the project directory.

2. **Run the script:**

    ```bash
    python audio.py
    ```

    Make sure to update the `pdf_file_path` and `output_audio_file` variables in `audio.py` to match your file names.

## Example

Here's how you can specify the file paths in the script:

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    pdf_file_path = 'your-pdf-file.pdf'  # Replace with your PDF file path
    output_audio_file = 'audiobook.mp3'  # Replace with your desired output audio file name

    convert_pdf_to_audiobook(pdf_file_path, output_audio_file)
```
